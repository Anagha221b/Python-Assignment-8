Data Visualization in Python

This assignment incorporates key topics such as line plots, scatter plots, and bar charts, each tailored to specific scenarios for analyzing and presenting data effectively. By mastering these techniques, you can uncover patterns, relationships, and insights that are otherwise hidden in raw data.

➢ Line Plots: Used for visualizing changes over time or continuous data trends.

➢ Scatter Plots: Ideal for analyzing relationships and correlations between two 
numerical variables.

➢ Bar Charts: Best suited for comparing categorical data, such as monthly 
performance or grouped metrics.
